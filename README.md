# CatNip-Financial-Tracker
This is an interactive and engaging web application that features a virtual pet cat, which users can care for based on their daily savings and expenses. Users manually input their financial transactions and savings, and the cat's appearance changes depending on the amount saved â€” it grows when savings increase and shrinks when they decrease. The app also allows users to set personal savings goals and track how their weekly expenses impact their progress. Additionally, it includes a machine learning model that forecasts future savings and expenses by analyzing data from previous weeks. Overall, the app offers a fun and straightforward way for users to manage their finances more responsibly.
